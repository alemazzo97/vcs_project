VCS PROJECT BY ARCUDI MAZZONI PADELLA
All the folders are organized in .zip files to gain storage.


ABOUT THE DATASET.
It was impossible to upload all the videos or all the frames so we organize the numeric dataset in order to have the possibility to replicate the scripts

ABOUT THE SCRIPTS.
We began our experiment downloading and organizing the frames in python with the computative power of our laptops, but once we begin to compute the models, we understood that we needed to move to colaboratory in order to have the computative power of the GPU.

ABOUT THE GRAPHICS.
There is a folder that provides all the graphics about the loss and accuracy evolution of the models

ABOUT THE TEX.
in the tex folder there are all the images and the files necessary to execute the .tex file and get the report.
